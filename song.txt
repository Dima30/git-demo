Big City Life
Me try forget by
Pressure nah ease up no matter how hard me try
Big City Life
Here my heart have no base
And right now Babylon deep on me case

Big City Life
Try forget by
Pressure nah ease up no matter how hard me try
Big City Life
My heart have no base
And right now Babylon deep on me case

People in a show
All lined in a row
We just push on by
It's funny
How hard we try
Take a moment to relax
Before you do anything rash

Don't you wanna know me?
Be a friend of mine
I'll share some wisdom with you
Don't you ever get lonely
From time to time?
Don't let the system get you down
